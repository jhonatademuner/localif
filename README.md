# Extractor based image recognition

LocalIf ​​is an image recognition application specifically designed for the IFES Campus Serra. With a comprehensive database, the program stores information about the various locations on campus. Using two feature extractors, LocalIf ​​analyzes the photos sent by the user and determines the corresponding location.

## Project Status

Functional: Access to functionalities through code or application.

## Features and Application Demo

- The user can take pictures inside the campus using the Android compatible mobile app built with Kotlin in Android Studio, allowing convenient use at any time.
- Through image processing performed in Python, all photos in the database and photos taken by the user are converted to PGM format, standardizing them in grayscale.
- The system is mainly implemented in C language, using two main structures for handling information.
- The first structure is responsible for creating the database, where the characteristics of each image are extracted and stored individually in text files (.txt).
- Descriptor extraction is performed using two different methods: histogram and statistical shape extractor. Extracted descriptors are saved in separate folders.
- The second framework is focused on image recognition. The input photo descriptors are extracted and Euclidean distances are calculated between it and the database image descriptors.
- The results are averaged weighted on each base image, providing greater accuracy.
- The structure is sorted based on the results, from lowest to highest value, displaying the five most similar locations and their corresponding images.
  Note: The usage of photos from locations other than the IFES Campus Serra can lead to inaccurate results, as the database is specific to that territory.
